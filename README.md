## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start

run on http://localhost:3000/
```
To test the application:
```bash
npm test
```
## Page Introduction - 3 Pages
- **Homepage** - intial page - List of StarWar characters 
- **My Favourite** - It is place where the user can  see all starwar character that they have add to the list.
- **View Detail** - Shows the starwar charcter Details including Gender, Height, Film and starship.

## My task
The features that I have Implemented:
- Ability to view all the Starwar character.
- Ability to view the details of the each Starwar Characters.
- Ability to add StarWar character to their favourite list.
- Ability to modify the height of the StarWar character on My Favourite page

## Additional task
- Added some couple of tests to the components.
- Even more cleaning of the code by reducing the line of code as possible by creating seperate components.

## Feature Improvements
If I had more time:
- Should have implemented loading status to show the user that it is loading.
- On the favourite page, I should have implemented the edit icon next to height detail to show the user that they can edit the height information of the StarWar character.
- Should have implemented popover info for heart icon to tell the user what it is ("Add to Favourite" and other elements (bin icon on favourite page.) )
- Able to modify the height of the StarWar on My Favourite page
